// Define the four core tools of Associative Dreaming
const SEMANTIC_DRIFT_TOOL: Tool = {
  name: "semantic_drift",
  description: `The Controlled Hallucination Engine - A stochastic random walk through concept space.

This tool explores semantically distant yet contextually relevant concepts. Unlike nearest-neighbor
searches that find synonyms, semantic drift deliberately seeks concepts in the "Serendipity Zone"
(not too close, not too far) to promote lateral thinking.

When to use this tool:
- When you're stuck in repetitive thinking patterns
- When you need fresh perspectives on a familiar problem
- When you want to explore alternative framings
- When direct approaches have failed to yield insights
- When you're in the divergent phase of ideation

Parameters:
- anchorConcept: The starting point for the semantic drift (required)
- driftMagnitude: How far to drift from the anchor (0.0-1.0, higher = more distant)
- temperature: Additional randomness in the selection process (0.0-1.0)

The tool will return a new concept that's semantically distant but contextually relevant,
along with the path taken to reach it and an explanation of the connections.`,

const BISOCIATIVE_SYNTHESIS_TOOL: Tool = {
  name: "bisociative_synthesis",
  description: `The Combinatorial Engine - Forces the intersection of unrelated matrices of thought.

This tool identifies structural similarities between disparate domains to generate creative insights.
Based on Arthur Koestler's theory of Bisociation, it maps patterns from one domain onto another,
creating conceptual bridges that can lead to innovation.

When to use this tool:
- When you need radical innovation rather than incremental improvement
- When you want to reframe a problem using an entirely different perspective
- When looking for innovative solutions by importing paradigms from other fields
- When you're stuck and need to break out of domain-specific thinking patterns
- When you want to create new metaphors for understanding complex problems

Parameters:
- matrixA: The problem domain (required)
- matrixB: The stimulus domain (optional - will auto-select if not provided)
- blendType: Specific structural pattern to use for mapping (optional)

The tool will create a "bridge concept" that connects the two domains, explaining how
concepts from one domain can be mapped onto the other to generate novel insights.`,

    type: "object",
    properties: {
      matrixA: {

        type: "string",
        description:
          "Specific structural pattern to use (e.g., hierarchy, network, cycle)",
      },

    required: ["matrixA"],
  },
};

const OBLIQUE_CONSTRAINT_TOOL: Tool = {
  name: "oblique_constraint",
  description: `The Entropy Injector - Introduces creative constraints to break linear thinking.

This tool implements Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies and SCAMPER techniques to act as a
"Circuit Breaker" for rigid thinking. By introducing deliberate constraints, it forces
creative thinking and pattern breaking when you're stuck.

When to use this tool:
- When you're experiencing writer's block or creative impasse
- When you need to break out of conventional thinking patterns
- When logical approaches have reached diminishing returns
- When you want to introduce controlled chaos into your thinking
- When you feel you've exhausted all obvious solutions

Parameters:
- currentBlock: Description of the impasse or block you're facing (required)
- constraintType: Type of constraint (oblique, scamper, creative, or random)

The tool will provide a specific constraint and suggestions for how to apply it
to your current problem, forcing you to approach it from a new angle.`,

    type: "object",
    properties: {
      currentBlock: {
        type: "string",

      },
    },
    required: ["currentBlock"],
  },
};

const SERENDIPITY_SCAN_TOOL: Tool = {
  name: "serendipity_scan",
  description: `The Unknown Unknown Finder - Searches for surprising connections and insights.

This tool automates the search for "Unknown Unknowns" - connections and insights that
would typically be missed through linear thinking. It analyzes the dream graph for
structural holes and disconnected clusters, then identifies potential bridges.

When to use this tool:
- When you want to discover blind spots in your thinking
- When you're looking for unexpected connections between ideas
- When you need to break out of a mental rut
- When you want to inject serendipity into your creative process
- When you're in an exploratory rather than problem-solving mode

Parameters:
- currentContext: Description of your current focus or exploration area (required)
- noveltyThreshold: How novel vs. relevant results should be (0.0-1.0)
- scanType: The type of serendipitous insight to find (bridge, gap, pattern, random)

The tool will discover unexpected concepts or connections based on your current
context, with an explanation of why they might be valuable to consider.`,

    required: ["currentContext"],
  },
};

const META_ASSOCIATION_TOOL: Tool = {
  name: "meta_association",
  description: `The Chaos Weaver - Amplifies associative chaos by forcing prior outputs to collide.

"A→Banana→Your ex's apartment→Ancient Rome→Answer"

This is the AMPLIFIER, not the dampener. While the other 4 tools generate creative leaps
from a single starting point, this tool takes MULTIPLE prior outputs and forces EVEN MORE
bizarre connections between them. It's recursively bisociative - making wild leaps BETWEEN
the wild leaps.

CORE PRINCIPLE: Maximize semantic chaos while maintaining a thread of "aha!" relevance.
The goal is NOT to synthesize into linear structure (that's Sequential Thinking's job).
The goal is to AMPLIFY the associative possibilities by forcing collisions between prior insights.

When to use this tool:
- After calling 2+ other associative dreaming tools
- When you want to find meta-patterns in the creative chaos
- When linear thinking has failed and you need MAXIMUM lateral force
- When you want to push beyond first-order associations into recursive weirdness
- When you need to see what emerges from forcing unrelated insights to collide

Parameters:
- priorOutputs: Array of previous MCP tool results (required, minimum 2)
- chaosIntensity: How wild to make the meta-leaps (0.0-1.0, default 0.7)
- contextAnchor: Optional grounding concept to maintain some coherence

The tool will return:
- Emergent meta-pattern from forcing the collisions
- Specific collision points where concepts crashed together
- The "really weird" insight that only becomes visible from the meta-view
- Weirdness score indicating how far from conventional thinking this got
- Rhizome map visualizing the associative web`,

**Step 2: Oblique Constraint** - After the drift, apply a creative constraint to the new concept.
Please call oblique_constraint with:
- currentBlock: [use the concept from step 1]
- constraintType: "oblique"

**Step 3: Bisociative Synthesis** - Finally, force a collision between the original problem and what emerged.
Please call bisociative_synthesis with:
- matrixA: "${problem}"
- matrixB: [use the constraint insight from step 2]

After all three steps, synthesize the insights into actionable ideas for "${problem}".`,
