/**
 * Creative Scaffolds - LLM Prompt Engineering System
 *
 * PHILOSOPHY:
 * The MCP server should NOT try to be creative itself. It should provide
 * SCAFFOLDING that guides Claude's actual hyperdimensional pattern-matching
 * capabilities toward productive lateral thinking.
 *
 * Instead of: Server generates "throughput ⟷ tension" (meaningless template)
 * We want: Server returns structured prompt that causes Claude to make genuine insight
 *
 * These scaffolds are designed to:
 * 1. Frame the creative task with constraints that produce insight
 * 2. Provide structural templates that Claude fills with genuine reasoning
 * 3. Include "because chains" that force justification of connections
 * 4. Ground abstract leaps in the user's actual problem context
