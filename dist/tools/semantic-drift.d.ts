/**
 * Semantic Drift - Controlled Hallucination Engine (CALIBRATED v3.0)
 *
 * This tool implements a stochastic random walk through the concept space,
 * seeking semantically distant yet contextually relevant concepts.
 *
 * V3.0 CRITICAL CALIBRATION FIX:
 * - Empirically calibrated distance formulas to match requested drift
 * - Corrects 100% overshoot at low drift (30% → 60%)
 * - Corrects 24% undershoot at high drift (90% → 68%)
 * - Adaptive hop calculation prevents distance compounding
 * - Temperature scaling now proportional and predictable
 * - Drift accuracy feedback in explanations
 * - Maintains creative exploration while ensuring precision
 *
 * V2.1 OPTIMIZATIONS:
 * - Loop detection: visitedConcepts Set prevents circular paths
 * - Progressive drift intensity: Each hop goes progressively further
 * - Aggressive high drift: 40% cross-domain chance at drift >= 0.7
 * - Better distance targeting: Prefer associations with distance > 0.6 for high drift
 * - Clean explanations: Removed "reverse: " prefix from reasons
 * - All methods updated to accept and use visitedConcepts Set
 *
 * V2.0 ENHANCEMENTS:
 * - Expanded from 150 to 500+ concept associations with modern tech (AI/ML, blockchain, quantum)
 * - TRUE semantic distance scoring (0.0-1.0) for each association
 * - Drift magnitude actually controls conceptual distance traveled
 * - Cross-domain bridge system for creative leaps
 * - Temperature adds genuine creative chaos
 * - Rich explanation formatting that actually appears in output
 * - Fixed synonym problem - prioritizes semantically distant concepts
 *
 * V2.2 ENHANCEMENTS:
 * - Added domain-specific associations (medical, business, technical)
 * - Expanded coverage to 600+ concepts with specialized terminology
